    - Rachel Siegfried

    description: The Flower Book explores 60 flowers, bloom-by-bloom in stunning portraiture.
      Lush macrophotography allows readers to see the details of each featured flower
      up close, from the amaryllis in spring, snapdragon in summer, and dahlia in
      fall to tropical wonders such as orchids and more. Intimate portraits of each
      flower include quick-reference profiles with tips for choosing the best blooms,
      care for cut stems, arranging recommendations, colors, shapes, and even growing
      tips to transform the home, from yard to tabletop. Gorgeous photographs throughout
      spotlight 30 sample floral arrangements that show how to design and build custom
      floral arrangements using featured blooms. Plus, a step-by-step techniques section
      walks beginners through the basics of foliage and fillers, bouquets, and arrangements
      to make this book as practical as it is beautiful. The Flower Book celebrates
      all the wonderful qualities of flowers-their sheer beauty, infinite variety,
      and power to evoke admiration-bloom by exquisite bloom.

    title: A Victorian Flower Dictionary
    subtitle: The Language of Flowers Companion
    authors:
    - Mandy Kirkby
    publisher: Ballantine Books
    publishedDate: '2011-09-20'
    description: "“A flower is not a flower alone; a thousand thoughts invest it.”
      Daffodils signal new beginnings, daisies innocence. Lilacs mean the first emotions
      of love, periwinkles tender recollection. Early Victorians used flowers as a
      way to express their feelings—love or grief, jealousy or devotion. Now, modern-day
      romantics are enjoying a resurgence of this bygone custom, and this book will
      share the historical, literary, and cultural significance of flowers with a
      whole new generation. With lavish illustrations, a dual dictionary of flora
      and meanings, and suggestions for creating expressive arrangements, this keepsake
      is the perfect compendium for everyone who has ever given or received a bouquet."

    subtitle: Flowers in Art
    authors:
    - Angus Hyland
    - Kendra Wilson
    publisher: Laurence King Publishing
    publishedDate: '2019-04-02'
    description: '"Art is the flower, life is the green leaf"—Charles Rennie Mackintosh
      Haphazard bunches, formal bouquets, chance arrangements, quiet and thoughtful
      rural encounters—The Book of the Flower is a sylvan collection of beautiful
      depictions of flowers by artists, photographers, and illustrators. Interspersed
      through the illustrations are short texts about the artists and their interest
      in particular flowers, from Georgia O''Keeffe''s sumptuous close-ups of Jimson
      Weed and cactus flowers to Matisse''s roses, Keika Hasegawa''s chrysanthemums,
      and Albert York''s close study of zinnias. A wonderful collection for art-lovers,
      gardeners, and flower-fanciers.'
